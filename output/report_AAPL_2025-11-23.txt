|---------------------|--------------------|----------|
| **Current Price**   | $271.49           | Trading near 52-week high, indicating bullish sentiment. |
| **Market Cap**      | $4.03 trillion    | Largest in the world, highlighting dominant scale. |
| **52-Week Range**   | $169.21 - $277.32 | ~60% gain from low; current price is 98% of high, showing resilience. |

| **Dividend Yield**  | 0.38%             | Modest; Apple prioritizes buybacks and reinvestment over dividends. |

- **Valuation Insights**: At a P/E of 36.34, AAPL trades at a premium to the S&P 500 average (~25x), justified by superior margins and cash generation. Free cash flow yield (~2%) supports ongoing share repurchases and innovation.
- **Performance Trend**: Stock has recovered strongly from 52-week lows, driven by AI integrations (e.g., Apple Intelligence) and services growth. Year-to-date gains position it as a market outperformer.

- **Regulatory/Geo-Political**: Antitrust suits (U.S./EU), tariffs on China supply chain (60%+ production).
- **Macro Risks**: Recession could curb consumer spending; forex headwinds from strong USD.
- **Product Cycles**: Dependence on iPhone (50%+ revenue); delays in AI/VR launches.
